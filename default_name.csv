1200.0,CAD,BUYING,"Gaming PC (GTX 1660 Ti, Ryzen 3700x)","Looking to sell my old system to buy a new graphics card for my new system. The system is good, it plays most games to a pretty good degree, even relatively new games like Forza Horizon 5 you can play at decent FPS if you dial down to like mid-high settings. I've even been able to run a triple monitor setup in games like Dirt Rally 2.0. It has the 3700x so it can handle lots, and 16 gb of ram, with 2 more slots if you wanna up it to 32gb down the line, I have it with 32gb for editing stuff, but I'm only selling it with 16 gb, which is more than enough for pretty much everything. With the price of stuff now due to the chip shortage/crypto scalpers, everything is pretty wild on price, so 1200$(reduced) is a fair price I think.",v-computer-components,2021/12/08,https://www.kijiji.ca/v-computer-components/edmonton/gaming-pc-gtx-1660-ti-ryzen-3700x/1597570928
